[Tutorial] - Basic Add a basic WhatsApp button


1. Adding your button:


* you can add this wherever you need it in whatever template you may decide:


<a href="https://wa.me/3197010240285?text=Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?"  target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; padding:16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #25D366; color: #fff; text-decoration: none; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Chat via WhatsApp</a>


NOTES:


Ok, in the first part of the button link in this example you will see: 3197010240285

That is an example country code and phone number


So you would say for example if you say live in the USA, note that your country code would be "1"

Thus you would need to add 1 plus your phone number in place of 3197010240285


Ok, next you will notice Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?

This is a basic url encoded message that will be sent on contact.

Ie:

This:

Not urlencoded = Hello, from a website vistor, do you have a moment to chat?

Becomes:

Urlencoded = Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?



Easy enough to understand, right?

Happy editing! Best of luck!  ;)  :cool:  ~ Vintagedaddyo
