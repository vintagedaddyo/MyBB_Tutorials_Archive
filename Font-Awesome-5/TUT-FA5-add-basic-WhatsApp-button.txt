[Tutorial] - Basic Add a basic WhatsApp button with FA5


1. Loading Font Awesome 5 *


In your Templates section of the MyBB ACP, find the Ungrouped Templates -> headerinclude template. 


Add the following after:

{$stylesheets}



External linking:


<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.4/css/all.css">


* you could also just include internally in headerinclude rather than externally in headerinclude if you have uploaded your library...


Internal linking:


<link rel="stylesheet" href="{$mybb->asset_url}/font-awesome-5/css/all.css">


* You can download font-awesome-5 pkg stripped down for size to be used for theme includes here:

https://filetransfer.io/data-package/vShTkNP0#link


* note: if there is already fa5 included in your template, then this include step is not needed and can be skipped



2. Adding your button: *


* you can add this wherever you need it in whatever template you may decide:


<a href="https://wa.me/3197010240285?text=Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?"  target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; padding:16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #25D366; color: #fff; text-decoration: none; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><i class="fab fa-whatsapp" style="padding-right:4px;"></i>Chat via WhatsApp</a>


NOTES:


Ok, in the first part of the button link in this example you will see: 3197010240285

That is an example country code and phone number


So you would say for example if you say live in the USA, note that your country code would be "1"

Thus you would need to add 1 plus your phone number in place of 3197010240285


Ok, next you will notice Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?

This is a basic url encoded message that will be sent on contact.

Ie:

This:

Not urlencoded = Hello, from a website vistor, do you have a moment to chat?

Becomes:

Urlencoded = Hello,%20from%20a%20website%20vistor,%20do%20you%20have%20a%20moment%20to%20chat?


Lastly, you will see:


<i class="fab fa-whatsapp" style="padding-right:4px;"></i>


Mkay, well, that is the FA5 WhatsApp icon on the button


Easy enough to understand, right?

Happy editing! Best of luck!  ;)  :cool:  ~ Vintagedaddyo
